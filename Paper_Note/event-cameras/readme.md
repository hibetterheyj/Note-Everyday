# Event Cameras

> 主要关注DVS相机，希望能结合机器学习，深度学习（如卷积或者脉冲神经网络）将其应用于机器人（如无人机），以实现在复杂多变的环境中自适应感知与决策！
> The main focus is on DVS cameras, hoping to integrate the dynamic information into the advanced machine learning and deep learning (such as convolution or spike neural network) for widely robotic applications (such as micro aerial vehicles). I think the sensor can empower the robots to achieve adaptive perception and decision-making in complex environments!
